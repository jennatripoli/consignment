# Virtual Consignment Site

This project is a consignment site that sells computers from online stores, built with JavaScript, React, and AWS. The site allows customers to view and purchase computers from a specific store or the entire site. Customers set their GPS location and can see shipping prices based on the distance between them and the store they are purchasing from. Customers can also compare two computers with each other, along with filter computers based on their specifications. Users can create a store with its own name and login credentials, where they can add and delete computers to be sold from their store. Store owners can also see the total revenue and inventory that their store has produced. Lastly, a validated site manager has administrative abilities, such as deleting stores and seeing the overall revenue and balance for the site.
